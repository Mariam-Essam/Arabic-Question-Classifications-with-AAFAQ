# Arabic-Question-Classifications-AAFAQ

This repository is dedicated to the research and development of Arabic Question Classification and Answer Generation. It introduces the **AAFAQ Taxonomy**, a novel classification schema designed to structure unstructured Arabic text data into meaningful categories.

## Repository Contents

- **Dataset**: A curated Arabic dataset of 5000+ labeled records, specifically tailored for question classification and answer generation tasks.
- **Fine-tuning Results**:
  - **AraBERT**: Results of fine-tuning AraBERT for multi-class classification.
  - **CAMeLBERT**: Results of fine-tuning CAMeLBERT for comparative performance evaluation.

## Key Features

- **AAFAQ Taxonomy**: A comprehensive classification schema covering:
  - **QuestionToolType** (نوع أداة الاستفهام)
  - **QuestionType** (نوع السؤال)
  - **List** (قائمة)
  - **AnswerType** (نوع الإجابة)
  - **Intent** (النية)
  - **CognitiveLevel** (المستوى المعرفي)
  - **Subjectivity** (الذاتية)
  - **TemporalContext** (السياق الزمني)
  - **PurposeContext** (سياق الغرض)
- **Fine-tuning Results**: Includes performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and loss for both AraBERT and CAMeLBERT models.

## Usage

The dataset and fine-tuning results are provided for researchers and developers interested in exploring Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP). These resources can be used for:
- Replicating our results.
- Extending research in Arabic question classification and answer generation.
